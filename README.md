## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Prerequisites**
    *   Install **XAMPP** or any PHP/MySQL server environment.

2.  **Database Setup**
    *   Open **phpMyAdmin** (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    *   Create a new database named `onlinecourses`.
    *   Import the `schema.sql` file located in the project root.
    *   **Crucial Step**: Run the `status` column update script.
        *   Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost/onlinecourses/update_enrollment_schema.php`
        *   This ensures the enrollment workflow functions correctly.

3.  **Project Configuration**
    *   Copy the project folder to `hw` (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\onlinecourses`).
    *   Ensure the `includes/db.php` file matches your database credentials (default is `root` with no password).

4.  **PHP Configuration (Important for Video Uploads)**
    *   To allow large video uploads, you must modify your `php.ini` file:
    *   Find the file at `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`.
    *   Update the following settings:
        ```ini
        upload_max_filesize = 500M
        post_max_size = 500M
        max_execution_time = 600
        max_input_time = 600
        ```
    *   **Restart Apache** in XAMPP after saving changes.
